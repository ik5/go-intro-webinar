# Go Intro

An introduction to the Go programming language (aka Golang).

Go into provides a Blog system.
Current Blog system is incomplete and contains errors inside including bad
design for providing the look and feel for the Go language and explaining issues
and what are the issues at hand.

## Why?

Go intro is part of a Webinar to provide a preview for the Go language.

Aim of the code is to show how-to think in Go instead of the boring
"Hello World" introduction.

Learning a syntax is easy, learning how-to think is a more complicated manner
that needs to address when learning a new programming language.

"Real World" application can provide such way of understanding the way a
language used rather than teaching syntax to an experienced developer.

## Audience

Software developers who work with programming language at least 3-5 years
and wish to learn how-to program in Go.
